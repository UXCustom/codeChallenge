Daily Code Challenge
=======================

The purpose of this repo is to provide a challenging javascript problem. Each day I will post a new code challenge as well as a solution to the previous day's challenge. Feel free to research a solution to the problem but please don't Google the complete answer. Remember, the point is for us to gain knowledge and learn the language better. We may never need to write these functions for a TechTarget project, but this is certainly good practice. Also, your code should be written in vanilla JS, don't use jQuery or any other library/framework.
